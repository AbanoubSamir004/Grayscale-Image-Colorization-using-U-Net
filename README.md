# Grayscale-Image-Colorization-using-U-NET

This project involves the development of a model that can colorize grayscale images using U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The model is trained on the Oxford-Pitts dataset, which consists of RGB images that are first converted to grayscale. The goal of the model is to take in a grayscale image and generate a colored version of the same image.

Features:

•	Trains a CNN model on grayscale images to predict colored versions of the same images

•	Utilizes the Oxford-Pitts dataset of RGB images
